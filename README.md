# Swiss homes analysis
The project aims to analyse the geographic distribution and 
socioeconomic indicators of housing apartments in Switzerland based on 
available datasets. Leveraging information on housing features, 
geographic coordinates, and socioeconomic data, the project seeks to 
understand the relationship between housing characteristics and the 
affluence of surrounding areas.
The analysis begins with the collection and preprocessing of relevant 
datasets, encompassing housing apartment features, geographic 
coordinates, and socioeconomic indicators. Exploratory data analysis is 
conducted to unveil distributions, correlations, and patterns within the 
data. Feature engineering techniques are employed to extract meaningful 
insights from the raw data, facilitating a deeper understanding of the 
housing landscape in Switzerland.
The results of the analysis provide valuable insights into the geographic 
distribution of housing apartments and their associated socioeconomic 
characteristics across different regions of Switzerland. Such insights can 
inform policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders about the spatial 
distribution of housing features and socioeconomic indicators, aiding in 
decision-making processes related to housing policies and community 
development initiatives.
